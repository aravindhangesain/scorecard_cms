            PV module warranty claims are a challenge for asset owners, even when there
            is clear evidence from a class action lawsuit that the supplier is at fault.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When a 100kW commercial PV system in California was underperforming by more
          than 90% – resulting in losses of &gt;$1,000 per month – the asset owner
          struggled for nearly a year to receive reimbursement even though its BP Solar
          modules were subject to a class action lawsuit.
        </p>

        <p>
          The lawsuit stipulates that BP Solar is only required to replace all modules in
          systems with &gt;20% failure rates. A replacement inverter that can detect arc
          faults is provided when PV systems do not meet the 20% threshold.
        </p>

        <p>
          BP Solar stopped producing PV modules in 2011, so the asset owner’s claim was
          handled by a third party. They determined that two of &gt;700 modules were
          eligible for replacement under the lawsuit: only modules with visible hotspots,
          burn marks and diode failures were covered.
        </p>

        <p>
          The asset owner pursued a claim based on BP Solar’s performance warranty
          instead. He learned that:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Only module-level testing conducted by an independent third party is accepted
            as evidence of performance loss. String or system-level data are not
            considered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Costs related to the inspection, installation, removal, reinstallation and
            transportation of PV modules are not covered.
          </li>
          <li>
            Financial losses due to system underperformance are not reimbursable.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The asset owner ultimately contacted PVEL for testing. We found that seven of
          ten randomly selected modules had burn marks and corrosion on the backsheet
          and showed clear signs of junction box defects. PV module underperformance
          ranged from 43% to 90%.

            PVEL’s thermal cycling test would have identified these defects, but it was
            not conducted prior to installation.
